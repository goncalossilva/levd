# levd

Daemon with configurable properties that will control NZXT Kraken x61 
liquid cooler.

### Dependencies

This project depends on glog, yaml-cpp and libusb. On fedora:

```
$ sudo dnf install yaml-cpp-devel glog-devel libusb-devel
```

### Building

To compile this project ensure you have an up-to-date cpp compiler toolchain 
that supports c++ 14. Also ensure you have the cmake build tool. To build:

```
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ sudo make install # Optionally
```

### Installing

Using `make install` will install the program and its necessary config files
into the filesystem. You'll need to run this command as sudo, as the installer
will copy files into directories outside of your home directory. Here's what 
the output of `make install` should look like:

```
[100%] Built target kraken
Install the project...
-- Install configuration: ""
-- Installing: /usr/bin/kraken
-- Up-to-date: /usr/bin
-- Installing: /usr/bin/kraken-start.sh
-- Installing: /etc/leviathan
-- Installing: /etc/leviathan/levd.cfg
-- Up-to-date: /etc/systemd/system
-- Installing: /etc/systemd/system/levd.service
```

### Setting up for use as daemon

Now that all of the necessary files have been copied into their respecive locations
(also with the correct permissions), you'll have to let systemctl be aware of the
modifications we're introducing. Follow the examples below:

```
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload # Use this whenever levd.service changes
$ sudo systemctl enable levd 
$ sudo systemctl start levd # stop sends SIGKILL to process, gracefully terminating
```

### Configuration

The program must see a valid `levd.cfg` file located in `/etc/leviathan`. A sample can
be found in the `config/` folder. Your configuration file must be in yaml format and 
contain at least the `fan_profile`, `enable_color`, and `main_color` properties. Later
properties are not supported at this moment.

To set a fan curve, add to the `fan_profile` list, other lists of size two.
These are data points which build your fan profile curve - x value being CPU temp 
(in C) and y value being fan percentage (in factors of 5, 30 being lowest, 100 highest).

Eg:
```
fan_profile: 
  - 
    - 30
    - 30
  -
    - 35
    - 40
  -
    - 40
    - 60
  -
    - 42
    - 70
  -
    - 43
    - 80
  -
    - 45
    - 100
```

At a CPU temperature of 30C the fan will operate at its lowest value, 30%. At a reading
of 37C the program will perform the necessary calculations to find the fan value 48% - 
then rounding up to the nearest multiple of 5, being 50%. All of this happens every 0.5s.

Also real-time updates to the `levd.cfg` file are supported. No need to relaunch the daemon
every time you modify a property.

The future project `levd-settings` will allow you to modify the `levd.cfg` file using a 
GUI using the Qt framework.


### Can I get some logs?

Sure, using journalctl you can see the programs stderr/stdout logs.

```
$ sudo journalctl -f -u levd.service

### Thank you to...

As I was reverse engineering the windows driver, I later found out that someone else did a way 
better job then me :) 

This project would not have been possible without contributions to the open source community from
jaksi.
